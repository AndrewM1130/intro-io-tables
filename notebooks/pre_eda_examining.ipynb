    "I would like to straighten out exactly what the goal of this project would be. We would like to develop network models and understand the stability of these systems under supply-chain shocks and the dynamics of the system thereafter. That is, if an industry like oil experiences a shortage, we would be interested in understanding the linkage or input/output changes if any exist. \n",

    "There is convergent consensus among scientists that many social, economic and financial phenomena can be described by a network of agents and their interactions. With that said, we believe alongside the literature that graph theory can be employed to help us understand the complicated dynamics and interactions of various commodities and sectors within the US. \n",

    "So for the most part, these columns appear to sum up nicely to the output column. There is an exception though. The early IO tables seem to have a lot of trouble getting the right answer. The question is what do I do about this? Well, we could remedy this by not transforming the NA values to 0 and instead filling them with what ever is left over from the difference of the column sums. An alternative is that there is something incorrect in my column sums formula which would explain the variance from the other columns sums that I did. I think for the time being, I just take note that they do not add up and examine this difference further during EDA. I think it may be safe, but maybe a bit to naive, to just set everything in all of these dictionaries to zero right off the bat. "
