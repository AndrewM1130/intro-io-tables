    "which is defined as the consumption matrix. This gives us a sense of what products are required to produce one unit of the output which is defined as the rows of the matrix and the columns denote the industries needed by that row to produce a unit. Additionally, we may have products outside of the industry that each row may require to make produce - say $[d_1, d_2, d_3]^T$ (known as **external demand**) so that our total amount produced in this economy is given by the Leontief Input-Output model:\n",

    "In our case, we first need to find this matrix $A$ from the IO table data that we have. We can do so by first dividing each row by the total industry output for that particular row and thus obtain values for each entry in that row that corespond to the percentage of that product's use for the industry in between 0 and 1. For now, I assume that this vector $\\hat{d}$ can be represented as the sum of the components in the total value added secondary industries. "
